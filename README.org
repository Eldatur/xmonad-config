* xmonad-config
  
xmonad-config is my [[http://xmonad.org/][xmonad]] configuration was inspired by [[https://github.com/vicfryzel/xmonad-config][Vic Fryzel]], [[https://gist.github.com/gilbertw1/c33e79eb76fcb5a47411da881c621639][gilbertw1]] and [[https://github.com/altercation/dotfiles-tilingwm][Ethan Schoonover]] 
* Introduction
  
If you are unfamiliar with xmonad, it is a tiling window manager that is notoriously minimal, stable, beautiful, and featureful.  If you find yourself spending a lot of time organizing or managing windows, you may consider trying xmonad.

However, xmonad can be somewhat difficult to configure if you're new to Haskell or even to xmonad itself.

This project contains a completely working and very usable xmonad configuration "out of the box".  If you are just starting out with xmonad, this will give you a configuration that I personally use every day. Thought it has been put into the colors, key bindings, layouts, and supplementary scripts to make life easier.

This project is also recommended for advanced xmonad users, who may just not want to reinvent the wheel.  All source provided with this project is well documented and simple to customize.

* Requirements
  
- xmonad
- xmonad-contrib
- [[http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/][xmobar]]
- [[http://stalonetray.sourceforge.net/][stalonetray]]
- [[https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/][rofi]]
** Installing requirements on [[http://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar stalonetray \
xcompmgr rofi
   #+END_SRC
** Installing requirements on [[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu Linux]]
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo aptitude install xmonad libghc-xmonad-contrib-dev xmobar stalonetray \
rofi
   #+END_SRC
* Installation
  
Installing xmonad-config is a matter of backing up any xmonad configuration you may already have, cloning the git repository, and updating your PATH.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
cd
mv .xmonad .xmonad.orig
git clone https://github.com/randomthought/xmonad-config.git .xmonad
#+END_SRC
Once xmonad-config is installed, you also need to ensure you can actually start xmonad. The mechanism to do this varies based on each environment, but here are some instructions for some common login managers.
** Starting xmonad from lightdm, xdm, kdm, or gdm
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
ln -s ~/.xmonad/bin/xsession ~/.xsession
# Logout, login from lightdm/xdm/kdm/gdm
   #+END_SRC
** Starting xmonad from slim
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
ln -s ~/.xmonad/bin/xsession ~/.xinitrc
# Logout, login from slim
   #+END_SRC
* Keyboard shortcuts
  
After starting xmonad, use the following keyboard shortcuts to function in your new window manager. I recommend you print these out so that you don't get stranded once you logout and back in.

* Personalizing or modifying xmonad-config
  
Once cloned, xmonad-config is laid out as follows.

All xmonad configuration is in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  This includes things like key bindings, colors, layouts, etc.  You may need to have some basic understanding of [[https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell][Haskell]] in order to modify this file, but most people have no problems.

Most of the xmobar configuration is in ~/.xmonad/xmobar.hs.

All scripts are in ~/.xmonad/bin/.  Scripts are provided to do things like take screenshots, start the system tray, start dmenu, or fix your multi-head layout after a fullscreen application may have turned off one of the screens. 

Colors set in the xmobar config and dmenu script are meant to coincide with the [[http://toddwerth.com/2008/04/30/the-last-vim-color-scheme-youll-ever-need/][IR_Black terminal and vim themes]].
